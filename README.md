# Human-Computer-Interaction-Touchless-Payphone-Report
Coursework Overview: CS-200 â€“ Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction

This report outlines the collaborative project undertaken by a group of students in the CS-200 module, focusing on the design and usability of a touchless payphone for public spaces. The project explored the intersection of interaction design, accessibility, and new technologies in response to the increasing demand for touchless solutions post-COVID.

The design process was approached through two stages: an autoethnographic study and a prototyping phase. In the first stage, we identified the advantages and challenges of touchless payphones, specifically considering user inclusivity for individuals with disabilities. Key features of the proposed design included eye tracking, contactless payment, multi-language support, and wheelchair accessibility.

Our user study aimed to determine the optimal screen size for usability. The results indicated that a larger screen size (35 inches) facilitated faster user interaction in 60% of cases. Additionally, 86.7% of participants supported the idea of incorporating more touchless interactions in public spaces.

In the second stage, we focused on addressing common issues with touchless interfaces, such as misinputs, user confusion, and external noise. Our design addressed these concerns through a user-friendly interface, clear instructions, and noise-reducing features. Ultimately, the project highlighted the potential for touchless technologies to improve accessibility and user experience in public spaces.
